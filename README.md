# PTA

**PTA** (PoE Trade Assistant) is currently a [PoE-TradeMacro](https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro) clone (with fewer features) that operates on the [Official Path of Exile Trade](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade) website instead of third-party alternatives. It hopes to become a full fledged trade assistant tool in the future.

**NOTE:** As with any pricing tools, never trust or rely on its results entirely. If something seems off, confirm with a manual search. It could very well be an issue with the app itself.

PTA is licensed under GPL-3.0

## Installation and Usage

Extract the archive and run **PTA.exe**

[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe) is required on PCs not running Windows 10 with the latest feature updates.

PTA provides the **Ctrl+D** and **Ctrl+Alt+D** shortcuts much like [PoE-TradeMacro](https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro), which provides simple and advanced (by mods) item searches on www.pathofexile.com/trade. These shortcuts can be re-configured in the settings.

## Building

Only Windows x64 is supported.

[Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/) is required.

[Qt 5.12 or later](http://www.qt.io/) is required.

Build using the Visual Studio Solution file.
